### Built with

### What I learned

First of all, I learned about the fundementals of coding in html-css format.
Coming from a background of Java and C++ it was a great experience for me to learn about the basics CSS and html.
I hope to learn more about what I can develop with thse tools in the future

Some of the biggest things I learned were: 
-The @media rule in CSS allows similar sites to be displayed differently depending on screen resolutions
-The .container class allows developers to store items in a fixed width container
-The term "rem" and how essential it is to development in CSS (root-element-font-size)
-How to import and use fonts from the google fonts library
-The inherit keyword and how it can be used to transfer data from parent objects to their children
-list and button objects and their syntax in css
-A whole lot more of the basics of css and html

### Continued development

Having followed a tutorial on youtube to assist me in building this project, I hope to use more liberties in future CSS and html projects.
